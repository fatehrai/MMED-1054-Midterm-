			<p>Mountainous places clearly make for a better vacation experience because of the following reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>They allow you to get far away from society so you can have alone time with yourself of the few close loved ones you are travelling with.</li>
					<li>The views are far superior than beaches...I mean who wants to look at plain old sand and water all day?</li>
					<li>There is a lot more exploring that can be done in mountainous areas with all the trails you have access to.</li>

			<p>Mountainous places clearly make for a better vacation experience because of the following reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The weather that can be enjoyed on a tropical beach beats the cold weather in the mountains.</li>
					<li>You can cool down with a swim in water that is the perfect temperature.</li>
					<li>Beaches are much safer because there is no risk of falling off a cliff.</li>
