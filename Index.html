			<h2>Arguements for why Mountains make for a better vacation destination.</h2>
				<img src="images/Mountains.jpg" width="305" height="175" alt="Mountain vacation">
			<p>Mountainous places clearly make for a better vacation experience because of the following reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>They allow you to get far away from society so you can have alone time with yourself of the few close loved ones you are travelling with.</li>
					<li>The views are far superior than beaches...I mean who wants to look at plain old sand and water all day?</li>
					<li>There is a lot more exploring that can be done in mountainous areas with all the trails you have access to.</li>
				</ul>
